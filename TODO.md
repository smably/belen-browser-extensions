#### TODO
* Add "block all images" link in right sidebar
* Show some some indication on featured ads from first-time posters
* Bookmarklet to add "reset fields" button for search


#### DONE
* Fix linkify to retain red highlighting on blocked machine IDs
* Enhance linkify per Jules' suggestions: under user history, black number = all ads ever; green number = live + pending; red number = blocked + admin deleted
* Highlight ads from freemail accounts (bad!)
* Highlight ads from paid/ISP accounts (good!)
* Performance optimization (should be usable on 200-result page in Chrome and FF)
