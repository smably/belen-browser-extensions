Belen Browser Extensions
========================

Description
-----------

A pair of browser extensions to aid ad moderation in Belen.


Installation
-----------

The Chrome extension in self-contained. Just open Chrome's extensions panel, choose "load unpacked extension" and point Chrome at the extension directory.

I have been developing the Firefox extension online, using Mozilla's add-on builder.  I believe there is also a way to build Jetpack extensions locally, but you are on your own if you go that route.
