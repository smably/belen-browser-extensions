==== TODO ====

* Bookmarklet to add "reset fields" button for search
* Fix linkify to retain red highlighting on blocked machine IDs (possibly using wrapInner() with a callback function)
* Enhance linkify per Jules' suggestions: under user history, black number = all ads ever; green number = live + pending; red number = blocked + admin deleted
* Add "block all images" link in right sidebar
* Show some some indication on featured ads from first-time posters
* Highlight ads from free email domains (hotmail.*, yahoo.*, gmail.com, live.com)
