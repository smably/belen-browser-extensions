==== TODO ====

* Add "block all images" link in right sidebar
* Show some some indication on featured ads from first-time posters
* Highlight ads from freemail accounts (bad!):
  * hotmail.*
  * yahoo.*
  * gmail.com
  * live.com
  * y7mail.com
* Highlight ads from paid/ISP accounts (good!):
  * bigpond.com
  * dodo.co.au
  * iinet.com.au
  * tpg.com.au
  * optus.com.au
  * westnet.com.au
  * iprimus.com.au
  * internode.com.au
* Bookmarklet to add "reset fields" button for search


==== DONE ====

* Fix linkify to retain red highlighting on blocked machine IDs (possibly using wrapInner() with a callback function)
* Enhance linkify per Jules' suggestions: under user history, black number = all ads ever; green number = live + pending; red number = blocked + admin deleted
